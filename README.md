Hello, these are my projects writing in c.

### Descriptions:
1. Mario https://github.com/MollyXuemn/cs50-projects/blob/main/mario.c 

*I make a pyramids of game Mario and the user can decide how tall the pyramids by first prompting a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive.*

2. Credit https://github.com/MollyXuemn/cs50-projects/blob/main/credit.c

  *I write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via printf) 
  whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each’s format herein.*
  &nbsp;


3. Readability https://github.com/MollyXuemn/cs50-projects/blob/main/readability.c

  *I implement a program that computes the approximate grade level needed (the Coleman-Liau index) to comprehend some text.*
  &nbsp;


4. Caesar https://github.com/MollyXuemn/cs50-projects/blob/main/caesar.c

  *I design and implement a program, caesar, that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher by shifting each letter therein by some number of places. 
  For instance, he might write A as B, B as C, C as D, …, and, wrapping around alphabetically, Z as A. And so, to say HELLO to someone, 
  Caesar might write IFMMP.*
  &nbsp;


5. Plurality https://github.com/MollyXuemn/cs50-projects/blob/main/plurality.c

  *I implement a program that runs a plurality election. In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. 
  At the end of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.*
  &nbsp;


6. Runoff https://github.com/MollyXuemn/cs50-projects/blob/main/runoff.c

  *I implement a program that runs a runoff election. In an instant runoff election, voters can rank as many candidates as they wish. 
  If any candidate has a majority (more than 50%) of the first preference votes, that candidate is declared the winner of the election*
  &nbsp;


7. Helpers https://github.com/MollyXuemn/cs50-projects/blob/main/helpers.c

  *I implement a program that applies filters to BMPs image by taking the pixels of some original image, 
  and modifying each pixel in such a way that a particular effect is apparent in the resulting image.*

8. Volume https://github.com/MollyXuemn/cs50-projects/blob/main/volume.c

  *I implement a program that modifies the volume of an audio file*
